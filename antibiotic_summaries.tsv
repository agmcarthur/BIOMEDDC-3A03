antibiotic	summary
Eravacycline	Eravacycline is used for complicated intra-abdominal infections, particularly when resistant Enterobacterales are a concern. It is a newer fluorocycline related to tetracyclines and designed to retain activity against many tetracycline-resistant strains. Resistance can occur via efflux and other determinants, and activity varies by organism so susceptibility data matter.
ceftriaxone	Ceftriaxone is used once-daily IV/IM for pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, gonorrhea, and many community-acquired infections. It is a third-generation cephalosporin known for long half-life and good tissue penetration. Resistance commonly arises via ESBLs and AmpC enzymes in Enterobacterales and via altered penicillin-binding proteins in pneumococci.
azithromycin	Azithromycin is used for respiratory infections, some sexually transmitted infections, and atypical pathogens, often because of convenient dosing. It is a macrolide related to erythromycin, developed to improve tissue penetration and tolerability. Resistance is widespread through target methylation and efflux, and macrolide-resistant pneumococci and gonococci are important clinical concerns.
nafcillin	Nafcillin treats serious infections due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, including endocarditis and bacteremia. It is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin developed to remain active in the presence of staphylococcal beta‑lactamase. MRSA with altered penicillin-binding proteins is resistant, and some strains can also show tolerance or reduced susceptibility patterns that complicate therapy.
piperacillin	Piperacillin is used for severe hospital-acquired infections and covers many Gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas when susceptible. It is an extended-spectrum ureidopenicillin beta‑lactam developed to broaden Gram-negative coverage. Resistance can occur via beta‑lactamases, porin changes, and efflux, and combinations with inhibitors are often used to counter beta‑lactamase-mediated failure.
daptomycin	Daptomycin is used for serious Gram-positive infections such as MRSA bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis, but it is not used for pneumonia because it is inactivated by lung surfactant. It is a lipopeptide introduced as a potent bactericidal option for resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Resistance can develop via changes in cell membrane charge and cell wall physiology, especially with prolonged therapy or deep-seated infections.
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid	Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is used orally for infections where beta‑lactamase-producing organisms are likely, such as sinusitis, otitis, bite wounds, and some skin infections. It combines an aminopenicillin with clavulanate, a beta‑lactamase inhibitor introduced to overcome common plasmid beta‑lactamases. Resistance persists with ESBLs, AmpC enzymes, and altered penicillin-binding proteins, so it can be ineffective against many resistant Enterobacterales and resistant pneumococci.
neomycin	Neomycin is used mainly topically and orally for bowel decontamination because systemic use is limited by toxicity. It is an aminoglycoside with broad activity but poor absorption from the gut. Resistance can occur via modifying enzymes and reduced uptake, and widespread resistance limits effectiveness for some organisms.
cloxacillin	Cloxacillin is used (often orally or IV depending on region) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections. It is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin from the early anti-staphylococcal beta‑lactam class. Resistance is common in MRSA through altered targets (PBP2a), making cloxacillin unreliable where MRSA prevalence is high.
telavancin	Telavancin is used for certain serious Gram-positive infections, including MRSA skin infections and some pneumonia cases, depending on local approval and patient factors. It is a lipoglycopeptide designed to enhance activity and provide dual effects on cell wall synthesis and membrane function. Resistance is uncommon but can occur with cell wall changes, and toxicity considerations limit use in some patients.
meropenem	Meropenem is used for severe infections such as sepsis, meningitis, and complicated intra-abdominal infections due to susceptible organisms. It is a carbapenem designed for broad coverage and favorable CNS penetration relative to some agents. Resistance is driven by carbapenemases and permeability/efflux changes, with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and resistant Pseudomonas being major concerns.
methicillin	Methicillin was historically used to treat staphylococcal infections and is now mainly remembered as the reference drug for defining methicillin resistance. It is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin developed in the early era of anti-staphylococcal beta‑lactams. Resistance via mecA-encoded altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) created MRSA and made methicillin ineffective against many staphylococcal strains.
ampicillin-sulbactam	Ampicillin-sulbactam is used for mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections such as bite wounds, aspiration-related infections, and some intra-abdominal infections. It combines an aminopenicillin with a beta‑lactamase inhibitor to restore activity against many beta‑lactamase producers. Resistance is common in organisms with ESBLs, AmpC enzymes, or altered targets, and it is unreliable for many resistant Gram-negative rods.
rifabutin	Rifabutin is used as an alternative rifamycin for tuberculosis in some situations and for certain nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. It is a rifamycin developed with different pharmacokinetics and drug-interaction profile compared with rifampin. Resistance arises through RNA polymerase mutations and can confer cross-resistance with other rifamycins.
rifampin	Rifampin is a cornerstone drug for tuberculosis and is also used in combination regimens for certain staphylococcal and device-related infections. It is a rifamycin antibiotic that transformed TB therapy by enabling potent multi-drug regimens. Resistance emerges rapidly through RNA polymerase mutations if used alone, so it is almost always combined with other agents.
dicloxacillin	Dicloxacillin is an oral option for mild to moderate infections caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, particularly skin infections. It is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin developed for staphylococcal beta‑lactamase stability. MRSA and some coagulase-negative staphylococci with altered targets are resistant, so local MRSA rates strongly affect usefulness.
cefazolin	Cefazolin is widely used IV for surgical prophylaxis and for susceptible staphylococcal and streptococcal infections. It is a first-generation cephalosporin beta‑lactam with strong activity against many Gram-positive organisms. Resistance includes MRSA (altered target) and beta‑lactamase-producing Gram-negatives, and some infections show inoculum-related failures with certain staphylococcal beta‑lactamases.
oxacillin	Oxacillin is used for infections caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, including skin, bone, and bloodstream infections. It is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin designed to withstand staphylococcal beta‑lactamases. Resistance is chiefly driven by mecA/mecC (MRSA) producing an altered target, and such strains require non-beta‑lactam options.
nalidixic acid	Nalidixic acid was historically used for urinary tract infections and is now often discussed as an early quinolone and as a marker for reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility. It is a first-generation quinolone that predated modern fluoroquinolones. Resistance develops readily through target mutations and can signal broader quinolone resistance.
isoniazid	Isoniazid is a key first-line drug for tuberculosis treatment and for latent TB infection. It is a prodrug discovered in the mid-20th century that inhibits mycolic acid synthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Resistance commonly arises through mutations that reduce prodrug activation or alter targets, making multi-drug therapy essential.
phenoxymethylpenicillin	Phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) is used orally for mild to moderate streptococcal infections such as pharyngitis and for prophylaxis in some rheumatic fever settings. It is an acid-stable natural penicillin developed to allow oral dosing compared with penicillin G. Resistance is mainly due to beta‑lactamases and altered penicillin‑binding proteins, limiting activity against many staphylococci and resistant pneumococci.
clarithromycin	Clarithromycin is used for respiratory infections and as a key component of Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens where susceptibility remains. It is a macrolide developed to improve oral absorption and potency compared with erythromycin. Resistance via ribosomal methylation and efflux is common, and rising clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori can cause treatment failure.
delafloxacin	Delafloxacin is used for certain skin infections and, in some regions, respiratory infections, with activity that can include MRSA and some Gram-negative pathogens. It is a newer fluoroquinolone designed with improved activity in acidic environments seen in some infections. Resistance can develop via the usual quinolone mechanisms (target mutations and efflux), and cross-resistance may occur after prior fluoroquinolone exposure.
mupirocin	Mupirocin is used topically to treat impetigo and to decolonize nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in some infection-control programs. It is a topical antibiotic with a unique mechanism inhibiting isoleucyl‑tRNA synthetase. Resistance can develop via target mutations or acquisition of an alternate enzyme, and high-level resistance can undermine decolonization efforts.
aztreonam	Aztreonam is used for susceptible Gram-negative infections and is notable for being a beta‑lactam option for some patients with severe penicillin allergy. It is a monobactam that targets Gram-negative aerobes and was developed to minimize cross-reactivity with other beta‑lactams. Resistance occurs via ESBLs, AmpC, and some carbapenemases, and it has no activity against Gram-positive organisms or anaerobes.
tigecycline	Tigecycline is used for complicated skin and intra-abdominal infections and is sometimes used as part of regimens for resistant organisms when alternatives are limited. It is a glycylcycline related to tetracyclines, developed to overcome common tetracycline resistance mechanisms. Resistance can still arise through efflux and other mechanisms, and low blood levels make it a poor choice for bloodstream infections.
bacitracin	Bacitracin is mainly used topically for skin infections and wound care, and systemic use is rare due to toxicity. It is a polypeptide antibiotic from early antibiotic discovery with activity largely against Gram-positive organisms. Resistance can occur through target protection and transport mechanisms, and topical overuse can select resistant skin flora.
tetracycline	Tetracycline is used for acne, some respiratory and zoonotic infections, and as a class backbone for several derivatives. It is a classic tetracycline antibiotic discovered in the mid-20th century that inhibits protein synthesis. Resistance is common via efflux pumps and ribosomal protection proteins, leading to reduced effectiveness against many modern clinical isolates.
fosfomycin	Fosfomycin is used for uncomplicated urinary tract infections and is sometimes used in combination regimens for resistant infections depending on formulation and setting. It is an older antibiotic with a unique mechanism inhibiting early cell wall synthesis, rediscovered for modern use because of activity against some resistant Enterobacterales. Resistance can occur via reduced uptake and enzymatic inactivation, and susceptibility varies widely so testing helps guide use.
metronidazole	Metronidazole is used for anaerobic bacterial infections and certain protozoal infections, including C. difficile (historically) and intra-abdominal anaerobes. It is a nitroimidazole introduced for anaerobic and protozoal therapy and works via reductive activation in low-oxygen environments. Resistance is relatively uncommon in many anaerobes but can occur through reduced drug activation and other mechanisms, with higher concern in some organisms and settings.
erythromycin	Erythromycin is used for respiratory infections and for patients who cannot take beta‑lactams, though it is less favored now due to tolerability and resistance. It is a classic macrolide discovered in the mid-20th century and was a major alternative to penicillin. Resistance is common via ribosomal methylation and efflux, reducing activity against many modern respiratory pathogens.
ertapenem	Ertapenem is used once daily for complicated intra-abdominal and urinary infections and other mixed infections, but it does not reliably cover Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter. It is a carbapenem beta‑lactam developed for broad activity and convenient dosing. Resistance arises via carbapenemases and porin loss with beta‑lactamases, and increasing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales limits effectiveness.
bedaquiline	Bedaquiline is used for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis as part of combination regimens. It is a newer diarylquinoline that targets mycobacterial ATP synthase and represented a major modern advance in TB treatment. Resistance can emerge through target mutations and efflux, so it must be combined with other effective drugs to protect activity.
rifaximin	Rifaximin is used for traveler’s diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy prevention, and some cases of irritable bowel syndrome because it acts largely within the gut. It is a rifamycin derivative designed for minimal systemic absorption. Resistance can develop via RNA polymerase mutations, but clinical impact depends on indication and local ecology since exposure is largely intestinal.
benzylpenicillin	Benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) is used for susceptible streptococcal infections, neurosyphilis, and some serious infections where high IV levels are needed. It is a classic natural penicillin from early antibiotic history and helped define beta‑lactam therapy. Resistance occurs through beta‑lactamase production and altered targets, and many staphylococci and numerous Gram‑negatives are not reliably susceptible.
sulfamethoxazole	Sulfamethoxazole is most often used with trimethoprim for urinary infections, some skin infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. It is a sulfonamide that inhibits folate synthesis and became widely used early in antibiotic history. Resistance is common via altered target enzymes and increased PABA production, and regional resistance rates can be high in common urinary pathogens.
dalbavancin	Dalbavancin is used for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and is valued for very long-acting dosing that can reduce the need for repeated IV therapy. It is a lipoglycopeptide related to vancomycin developed for durable Gram-positive coverage, including MRSA in many cases. Resistance is uncommon but can occur via changes affecting glycopeptide binding and may overlap with vancomycin-intermediate phenotypes.
cefotaxime	Cefotaxime is used IV for serious infections including sepsis and meningitis when susceptible organisms are involved. It is a third-generation cephalosporin introduced to provide improved Gram-negative activity and CNS penetration. Resistance is often due to ESBLs, AmpC enzymes, or altered targets, making it unreliable against many modern resistant Enterobacterales.
imipenem	Imipenem is used for severe polymicrobial and Gram-negative infections, often in hospitals, and is paired with cilastatin to prevent renal metabolism. It is a pioneering carbapenem with very broad beta‑lactam activity. Resistance occurs via carbapenemases, porin loss, and efflux, and some organisms have intrinsic resistance or can rapidly select resistant subpopulations.
pyrazinamide	Pyrazinamide is used as part of standard tuberculosis therapy to shorten treatment duration. It is a prodrug that works best in acidic environments and was a major historical advance in TB regimen design. Resistance is driven by mutations affecting drug activation or targets and is common in some resistant TB strains.
norfloxacin	Norfloxacin was used mainly for urinary tract infections and some gastrointestinal infections but is less commonly used now. It is an early fluoroquinolone optimized for urinary concentrations. Resistance via target mutations and efflux is common and often cross-confers resistance to other quinolones.
oritavancin	Oritavancin is used for acute bacterial skin infections and can be given as a single-dose IV therapy in some settings. It is a lipoglycopeptide that retains activity against many Gram-positive organisms including MRSA and some vancomycin-resistant enterococci types. Resistance is rare but possible via cell wall target changes, and clinical use is guided by local susceptibility patterns and indication.
lincomycin	Lincomycin is used less commonly today but can treat some Gram-positive and anaerobic infections when susceptible. It is the original lincosamide antibiotic from which clindamycin was developed. Resistance occurs via ribosomal target modification and efflux, and cross-resistance with macrolides can occur.
delamanid	Delamanid is used for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in combination regimens. It is a nitroimidazole-class antimycobacterial developed to expand options for resistant TB. Resistance can occur through impaired prodrug activation and other mechanisms, and it is used alongside multiple other active agents to prevent failure.
linezolid	Linezolid is used for resistant Gram-positive infections such as MRSA pneumonia and VRE infections, and it has excellent oral bioavailability. It is an oxazolidinone introduced as a major advance for treating resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Resistance occurs through ribosomal mutations or acquired genes, and prolonged therapy can be limited by bone marrow suppression and neuropathy.
ethambutol	Ethambutol is used in combination therapy for tuberculosis to help prevent resistance during early treatment. It is an antimycobacterial agent discovered in the mid-20th century that inhibits arabinogalactan cell wall synthesis. Resistance occurs through target gene mutations, and visual toxicity monitoring is important during therapy.
fidaxomicin	Fidaxomicin is used for Clostridioides difficile infection and is valued for reducing recurrence compared with some alternatives. It is a narrow-spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic that acts mainly in the gut. Resistance is uncommon but can occur through RNA polymerase changes, and stewardship aims to preserve its role for C. difficile.
ceftaroline	Ceftaroline is used for skin infections and pneumonia and is notable for activity against MRSA in many settings. It is an advanced cephalosporin engineered to bind altered staphylococcal targets. Resistance can emerge via further target changes and some Gram-negative beta‑lactamases still inactivate it, so its Gram-negative coverage is limited.
fusidic acid	Fusidic acid is used in some countries for staphylococcal skin infections and occasionally in combination for deeper infections. It is a steroidal antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis by targeting elongation factor G. Resistance can emerge rapidly via target mutations, so it is often used with caution and sometimes in combination therapy.
cefuroxime	Cefuroxime is used for respiratory infections and, in IV form, for some serious infections when susceptible organisms are expected. It is a second-generation cephalosporin that broadened Gram-negative coverage compared with earlier cephalosporins. Resistance is common via beta‑lactamases and target changes, and ESBL-producing Enterobacterales are typically resistant.
cefiderocol	Cefiderocol is used for difficult-to-treat Gram-negative infections, including some carbapenem-resistant organisms, when other options are limited. It is a siderophore cephalosporin that hijacks bacterial iron uptake to enter cells, a newer strategy in beta‑lactam design. Resistance has been reported through changes in iron transport, beta‑lactamases, and target alterations, and susceptibility testing is important because activity varies by organism and mechanism.
tobramycin	Tobramycin is used for serious Gram-negative infections and is also used as an inhaled therapy for Pseudomonas in cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. It is an aminoglycoside with strong antipseudomonal activity. Resistance arises through aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and decreased uptake, and chronic use can select resistant Pseudomonas populations.
pretomanid	Pretomanid is used in specific combination regimens for highly drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis. It is a nitroimidazo-oxazine that acts as a prodrug and can affect mycobacterial energy and cell wall pathways. Resistance can occur via reduced activation and related mechanisms, reinforcing the need for fully active combination therapy.
ampicillin	Ampicillin is used for susceptible enterococcal infections, Listeria meningitis (with an aminoglycoside in some settings), and certain urinary or respiratory infections. It is an aminopenicillin beta‑lactam introduced as a broader-spectrum penicillin than earlier agents. Resistance frequently arises from beta‑lactamases and reduced permeability, and many Gram‑negative rods and staphylococci are resistant.
amikacin	Amikacin is used for severe infections due to resistant Gram-negative bacteria and in some regimens for mycobacterial disease. It is an aminoglycoside engineered to evade many common aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes that inactivate gentamicin and tobramycin. Resistance still occurs via specific modifying enzymes, 16S rRNA methylation, and reduced uptake, so susceptibility testing is essential.
