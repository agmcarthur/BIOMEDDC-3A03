23S rRNA (adenine(2058)-N(6))-methyltransferase Erm(A)	Erm(A) is a ribosomal RNA methylase that was first recognized in Gram‑positive pathogens as a cause of MLSB resistance and later shown to move on transposons and plasmids between staphylococci and streptococci. It is common in community and hospital isolates where macrolide and lincosamide use is high, and it often co-travels with other resistance determinants in multidrug clones. Erm(A) reduces activity of erythromycin and azithromycin and can confer inducible or constitutive resistance to clindamycin (and related macrolides/lincosamides/streptogramin B drugs).
ErmB	ErmB is one of the most widespread erm genes and was historically described in streptococci and enterococci before becoming common in diverse Gram‑positive and anaerobic bacteria through mobile elements. It is frequently detected in human and animal reservoirs and is strongly associated with macrolide exposure and transmission of resistant lineages. ErmB compromises erythromycin and other macrolides and typically drives cross‑resistance to clindamycin and streptogramin B.
ErmC	ErmC was initially characterized in staphylococci and became a classic example of inducible macrolide–lincosamide resistance carried on small plasmids. It remains prevalent in skin and soft‑tissue staphylococcal isolates and can spread in both community and healthcare settings. ErmC decreases susceptibility to erythromycin and azithromycin and can cause inducible clindamycin resistance with broader MLSB cross‑resistance.
tet(M)	tet(M) encodes a ribosomal protection protein first studied in streptococci and enterococci and later found broadly disseminated on conjugative transposons such as Tn916‑like elements. It is globally common in clinical, livestock, and environmental isolates, reflecting heavy tetracycline use and efficient horizontal transfer. tet(M) mainly affects tetracycline and doxycycline and often also reduces minocycline activity (but not reliably tigecycline).
tet(K)	tet(K) is a tetracycline efflux pump historically associated with staphylococci and carried on small plasmids that circulate in both humans and animals. It is common in community staphylococcal strains and can accumulate with other resistance genes in livestock‑associated lineages. tet(K) primarily confers resistance to tetracycline and usually has less impact on doxycycline and minocycline.
tet(C)	tet(C) encodes a tetracycline efflux pump that was described early in Enterobacterales and became established on plasmids that circulate across many Gram‑negative hosts. It is encountered in food, animal, and human isolates, often alongside other plasmid-borne resistance genes. tet(C) primarily confers resistance to tetracycline and tends to have weaker effects on doxycycline and minocycline.
tetA(P)	tetA(P) is a tetracycline efflux determinant originally described in anaerobic and clostridial contexts and is often linked to mobile genetic elements in gut-associated bacteria. It appears in animal and human microbiomes where tetracycline exposure selects for maintenance and transfer. tetA(P) mainly reduces susceptibility to tetracycline-class agents such as tetracycline and, variably, doxycycline.
tetB(P)	tetB(P) is another clostridial-associated tetracycline efflux gene that has been studied as part of mobile resistance modules in intestinal bacteria. Its presence is enriched in settings with agricultural tetracycline use and can be detected in fecal and environmental surveillance. tetB(P) chiefly impacts tetracycline and may contribute to decreased doxycycline activity depending on host background.
vanA	vanA was first recognized in Enterococcus faecium/faecalis as the defining gene cluster behind high-level glycopeptide resistance and then spread internationally via plasmids and transposons. It is now a hallmark of hospital-adapted enterococcal lineages and is closely tracked in infection-control surveillance because of outbreak potential. vanA confers high-level resistance to vancomycin and typically also teicoplanin.
vanB	vanB emerged in enterococci as an alternative vancomycin-resistance cluster that is often chromosomal or carried on mobile elements distinct from vanA. It is common in healthcare-associated enterococci in multiple regions and can be difficult to detect phenotypically because resistance levels vary. vanB causes resistance to vancomycin while usually retaining susceptibility to teicoplanin.
mecA	mecA was identified as the central determinant of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and is carried on the SCCmec element that has diversified into multiple lineages. It is globally prevalent in both hospital- and community-associated staphylococci and is a cornerstone marker in epidemiologic tracking of MRSA and MRSE. mecA confers resistance to virtually all beta-lactams, including methicillin/oxacillin, most cephalosporins, and carbapenems (with ceftaroline often retaining activity depending on strain).
CTX-M-15	CTX-M-15 is an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) that rose to prominence in the 2000s, especially in Escherichia coli ST131 and related plasmid lineages. It is now one of the most common ESBLs worldwide in community urinary tract infections and healthcare-associated bacteremia, reflecting efficient plasmid spread and antibiotic pressure. CTX-M-15 compromises third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (often ceftazidime as well) and reduces effectiveness of many penicillins and aztreonam unless combined with an active inhibitor.
CTX-M-14	CTX-M-14 is a CTX-M group 9 ESBL that expanded in Asia and Europe and has been repeatedly introduced into diverse Enterobacterales via plasmids. It is frequently detected in both human and food-animal reservoirs and can circulate in the community alongside other ESBLs. CTX-M-14 primarily hydrolyzes cefotaxime and ceftriaxone and can affect other oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreonam, limiting standard beta-lactam therapy.
KPC-2	KPC-2 was first described in Klebsiella pneumoniae in the United States and rapidly became a defining carbapenemase of global high-risk clones. It is now endemic in many regions with major hospital outbreaks and is often plasmid-borne, enabling spread across Enterobacterales species. KPC-2 reduces activity of carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem) and many penicillins and cephalosporins; newer inhibitor combinations such as ceftazidime–avibactam may remain active unless additional mutations arise.
KPC-3	KPC-3 is a common variant of KPC carbapenemase that emerged within epidemic Klebsiella pneumoniae lineages and then spread internationally via plasmids. It is most often encountered in hospitals and long-term care settings where inter-facility transmission sustains regional endemicity. KPC-3 reduces activity of carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem) and many other beta-lactams, and treatment may require newer inhibitor combinations depending on additional mutations and permeability changes.
NDM-1	NDM-1 was first reported from the Indian subcontinent in Enterobacterales and quickly became a global public-health concern through travel and plasmid dissemination. It is now found across continents in diverse Gram-negative species and is frequently linked to additional resistance genes that limit treatment options. NDM-1 inactivates carbapenems and most beta-lactams (but not aztreonam unless an ESBL/AmpC is also present), often leaving only a few agents such as polymyxins, tigecycline, or newer combinations depending on the strain.
VIM-2	VIM-2 is a metallo-beta-lactamase that was described in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacterales and disseminates via class 1 integrons and plasmids. It is reported worldwide, especially in hospital settings, and is a common driver of difficult-to-treat Pseudomonas outbreaks. VIM-2 compromises carbapenems and most beta-lactams (excluding aztreonam in isolation) and often coexists with other mechanisms that further narrow therapy.
IMP-1	IMP-1 was among the earliest recognized metallo-beta-lactamases, first reported in Japan and then detected globally in multiple Gram-negative species. It spreads through integrons and plasmids and remains an important cause of carbapenem resistance in both Enterobacterales and non-fermenters. IMP-1 reduces activity of carbapenems and most beta-lactams (again sparing aztreonam unless paired with other enzymes), frequently necessitating reliance on non–beta-lactam options.
OXA-48	OXA-48 is a class D carbapenemase that was first described in Klebsiella pneumoniae and has since expanded widely across Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and beyond via epidemic plasmids. It is common in healthcare-associated transmission and can be hard to detect because it may confer only modest carbapenem MIC elevations unless additional porin loss occurs. OXA-48 compromises carbapenems (especially ertapenem) and penicillins, while many extended-spectrum cephalosporins may be spared unless an ESBL is co-produced.
OXA-23	OXA-23 is a major carbapenemase in Acinetobacter baumannii that became established in international clonal lineages through transposons and plasmids. It is strongly associated with hospital outbreaks, particularly in intensive care units, and is a leading cause of endemic carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in many regions. OXA-23 compromises carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem and contributes to broad beta-lactam resistance when combined with other resistance mechanisms.
TEM-1	TEM-1 is one of the earliest and most common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases described in Enterobacterales and remains widespread due to stable, low-cost plasmids. It is frequently found in community and hospital Escherichia coli and Klebsiella isolates and provides a platform from which extended-spectrum and inhibitor-resistant TEM variants can evolve. TEM-1 mainly confers resistance to ampicillin and related penicillins and can reduce activity of early cephalosporins, while amoxicillin-clavulanate may remain effective unless additional mechanisms are present.
SHV-12	SHV-12 is a widely distributed SHV-family ESBL that has been reported for decades, particularly in Klebsiella pneumoniae, and spreads on plasmids across Enterobacterales. It is common in hospital-associated infections and is often found alongside other resistance determinants in multidrug-resistant strains.

CMY-2	CMY-2 is a plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase that expanded in Escherichia coli and Salmonella from both human and food-animal sources and is now globally common. It is often detected in community-onset infections and food-chain surveillance, reflecting selection by cephalosporin use and successful plasmid lineages. CMY-2 confers resistance to cephamycins like cefoxitin and reduces susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, limiting many beta-lactam therapies.
DHA-1	DHA-1 is a plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase originally described in Enterobacterales and often linked to inducible regulation and mobile elements. It is reported worldwide, frequently in Klebsiella and Enterobacter species in hospital settings where cephalosporin pressure is intense. DHA-1 decreases susceptibility to cephamycins and many third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefoxitin, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone) and can undermine some inhibitor combinations.
MCR-1.1	MCR-1.1 is a plasmid-borne phosphoethanolamine transferase first highlighted in the mid‑2010s as a mechanism of transferable colistin resistance and rapidly found in humans, livestock, food, and the environment. Its epidemiology is shaped by agricultural and clinical polymyxin use and by spread of Inc-type plasmids across Enterobacterales. MCR-1.1 primarily impacts colistin (and often polymyxin B), reducing the effectiveness of last-line polymyxins.
QnrA1	QnrA1 was among the first plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants described, providing low-level protection of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It is detected worldwide in Enterobacterales, often on plasmids that also carry ESBLs, and it facilitates selection of higher-level fluoroquinolone resistance during therapy. QnrA1 reduces susceptibility to fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and can contribute to nalidixic acid resistance.
QnrB1	QnrB1 is a common qnr variant that spread widely in Enterobacter and Klebsiella species via diverse plasmids and integron-associated regions. It is frequently found in clinical isolates with other resistance genes, making it an important contributor to multidrug resistance epidemiology. QnrB1 decreases susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and other fluoroquinolones and helps enable stepwise acquisition of high-level resistance.
QnrS1	QnrS1 is a globally prevalent plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene that provides low-level protection of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It is found in Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and other Enterobacterales from humans, animals, and food systems, and it can facilitate stepwise selection of higher-level resistance.

AAC(6')-Ib	AAC(6')-Ib is a widely distributed aminoglycoside acetyltransferase that has long been reported in Enterobacterales and is often carried on integrons and plasmids. It is common in hospital-associated multidrug-resistant strains and frequently coexists with ESBL or carbapenemase genes. AAC(6')-Ib reduces activity of several aminoglycosides, notably amikacin, tobramycin, and kanamycin (effects on gentamicin can vary by variant).
AAC(6')-Ib-cr1	AAC(6')-Ib-cr is a fluoroquinolone-modifying variant of AAC(6')-Ib that was recognized in the 2000s and has since disseminated on common plasmids. It is frequently linked to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacterales in both community and healthcare settings, including successful Escherichia coli lineages. The enzyme reduces susceptibility to aminoglycosides such as amikacin and can also lower activity of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, making fluoroquinolone treatment less reliable.

ANT(2'')-Ia reduces activity of gentamicin and tobramycin and can affect other aminoglycosides depending on the resistance background.
armA	armA encodes a 16S rRNA methyltransferase that was first described in Enterobacterales and quickly recognized for causing very high-level aminoglycoside resistance. It has spread globally on plasmids, frequently alongside ESBLs and carbapenemases, and is associated with difficult-to-treat outbreaks. armA confers broad resistance to most clinically important aminoglycosides, including amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin.
sul1	sul1 encodes an altered dihydropteroate synthase and became a hallmark of class 1 integrons that disseminated widely in Gram-negative bacteria. It is common in clinical, wastewater, and agricultural surveillance and persists because it is often linked to other selected resistance genes. sul1 primarily confers resistance to sulfonamides such as sulfamethoxazole.
sul2	sul2 is a plasmid-associated sulfonamide resistance gene that has been widespread for decades in Enterobacterales from humans and animals. It often co-occurs with tetracycline and aminoglycoside resistance genes on broad-host-range plasmids, supporting global dissemination. sul2 mainly impacts sulfonamides including sulfamethoxazole and can undermine trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole when paired with a dfr gene.
dfrA1	dfrA1 encodes a trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase and is commonly carried as an integron cassette in Gram-negative bacteria. It is prevalent in both community and hospital isolates and is frequently linked to sul genes, reflecting co-selection by trimethoprim–sulfonamide use. dfrA1 confers resistance to trimethoprim and reduces the effectiveness of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole regimens when combined with sulfonamide resistance.
dfrA5	dfrA5 is another integron-associated trimethoprim resistance cassette that has been reported in diverse Enterobacterales worldwide. Its distribution is shaped by integron mobility and by co-selection on multidrug resistance regions in clinical and agricultural settings. dfrA5 primarily confers resistance to trimethoprim and contributes to failure of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole when paired with sul genes.
catA1	catA1 encodes a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase that was characterized early as a plasmid-borne mechanism of chloramphenicol resistance. It remains common in Enterobacterales from humans and animals, often persisting on legacy plasmids even where chloramphenicol use has declined. catA1 confers resistance to chloramphenicol and can also reduce susceptibility to related phenicols in some backgrounds.
floR	floR is a phenicol efflux gene that became prominent in animal-associated bacteria and then moved into human-associated Enterobacterales via plasmids and integrons. It is frequently detected in Salmonella and Escherichia coli from food production chains, consistent with selection from florfenicol and related phenicol use. floR confers resistance to florfenicol and typically also to chloramphenicol.

FosA3 compromises fosfomycin, including oral fosfomycin used for urinary tract infections.
cfrA	cfr-family genes encode rRNA methyltransferases that were first recognized in staphylococci from animal reservoirs and later found in human pathogens on transferable plasmids. They are concerning because they can spread silently with other resistance genes and reduce options for treating serious Gram-positive infections. cfrA confers resistance across multiple classes including phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones (e.g., linezolid), pleuromutilins, and streptogramin A.
optrA	optrA was described in enterococci as a transferable ABC-F protection mechanism and rapidly detected in multiple countries in both clinical and agricultural isolates. It is often plasmid-borne and can circulate in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, raising concern for linezolid stewardship. optrA reduces susceptibility to oxazolidinones such as linezolid and tedizolid and can also impact phenicols like chloramphenicol and florfenicol.
poxtA	poxtA is a more recently described transferable ABC-F resistance gene reported in enterococci and staphylococci, frequently on plasmids with other resistance markers. Its detection in both human and animal sources suggests cross-sector transmission and selection by use of multiple drug classes. poxtA can reduce activity of oxazolidinones (including linezolid), phenicols, and, in some contexts, tetracyclines.
PER-1	PER-1 is an ESBL that was first reported in the 1990s and became notable in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species as well as Enterobacterales. It has been associated with hospital outbreaks in several regions and often resides on mobile elements that aid spread.

GES-5 has been reported internationally, including in Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas, often on integron-bearing plasmids that enable rapid dissemination. GES-5 compromises extended-spectrum cephalosporins and can reduce carbapenem activity, with the exact profile depending on host permeability and co-resistance.
OXA-237	OXA-237 is a class D carbapenemase variant first described in Acinetobacter baumannii and later implicated in clonal hospital transmission events. Although less common than OXA-23, it can cause outbreaks when introduced into high-risk Acinetobacter baumannii lineages and may be missed without targeted molecular testing. OXA-237 reduces susceptibility to carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem and contributes to broad beta-lactam resistance in these backgrounds.
DHA-7	DHA-7 is a plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase variant reported in Enterobacterales surveillance studies and occasionally highlighted as an emerging or newly detected enzyme in specific regions. Its epidemiology is shaped by plasmid spread and cephalosporin selection, often in settings with high rates of multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex or related organisms. DHA-7 decreases susceptibility to cephamycins and many broad-spectrum cephalosporins and can undermine beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor therapies.
AAC(3)-IIa	AAC(3)-IIa is an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase common in Gram-negative bacteria and often found on plasmids and transposons. It is encountered in clinical Enterobacterales and can contribute to multidrug resistance when combined with beta-lactamases and quinolone resistance determinants.
